# --- PROJECT-WIDE GRADLE SETTINGS ---
# IDE (e.g. Android Studio) users:
# Gradle settings configured through the IDE *will override* any settings specified in this file.
# For more details on how to configure your build environment visit
# http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/build_environment.html

# Specifies the JVM arguments used for the daemon process. The setting is particularly useful for
# tweaking memory settings.
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4096M -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Dkotlin.daemon.jvm.options="-Xmx3072M"
# When configured, Gradle will run in incubating parallel mode.
# This option should only be used with decoupled projects. More details, visit
# http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html#sec:decoupled_projects

# The Daemon keeps a Gradle instance running in the background, avoiding the cost of starting up
# the JVM for every build.

# --- BUILD AND CONFIGURATION CACHING ---
# The BUILD CACHE focuses on the Execution Phase of a build. Its primary goal is to avoid re-running
# tasks by reusing their outputs from previous builds.
#
# - WHAT IT CACHES: The outputs of individual tasks, such as compiled classes, test results, and
# other generated files.
#
# - HOW IT WORKS: Before executing a task, Gradle calculates a unique "build cache key" based on all
# of the task's inputs (source files, classpath, etc.). It then checks if an output with that same
# key exists in the cache.
#       1- If a matching output is found (a "cache hit"), Gradle skips the task's execution and
#       simply pulls the output from the cache.
#       2- If no match is found, the task executes, and its outputs are stored in the cache with
#       the new key for future use.
#
# - PHASE ACCELERATED: It speeds up the Execution Phase by skipping redundant task work.
#
# - TYPES OF CACHE:
#       1- Local Cache: Stored on your local machine, useful for reusing outputs when switching
#       branches or re-running builds.
#       2- Remote Cache: A shared cache (often on a server) that allows teams and CI/CD servers to
#       share build outputs, dramatically speeding up builds for everyone.
org.gradle.caching=true

# CONFIGURATION CACHING focuses on the Configuration Phase, which happens before any tasks are
# executed. Its goal is to avoid re-evaluating your build scripts and creating the task graph on
# every build.
# - WHAT IT CACHES: A snapshot of the entire task graph for your build, including all the
# information about which tasks need to run and in what order.
#
# - HOW IT WORKS:
#       1- On the first build, Gradle runs the configuration phase as normal: it evaluates
#       settings.gradle, all build.gradle scripts, and determines the full graph of tasks to be
#       executed. It then saves a snapshot of this graph to the cache.
#       2- On subsequent builds, if your build scripts or other configuration files haven't changed,
#       Gradle can skip the entire configuration phase and load the task graph directly from the
#       cache. This can save a significant amount of time, especially in large, multi-module
#       projects where the configuration phase can take several seconds or even minutes.
#
# - PHASE ACCELERATED: It speeds up the Configuration Phase.

# Kotlin code style for this project: "official" or "obsolete":
kotlin.code.style=official

# This property enables incremental compilation for Kotlin/JVM and Kotlin/JS targets. Instead of
# recompiling all of your code every time you make a change, incremental compilation allows the
# compiler to only recompile the files that were affected by your changes. It tracks the changes
# between builds and intelligently determines the smallest set of files that need to be reprocessed,
# significantly speeding up the development cycle.
kotlin.incremental=true

# This is a more specific flag that enables incremental compilation for multiplatform projects.
# While the general kotlin.incremental flag works for JVM and JS, multiplatform projects have a more
# complex structure. This flag ensures that the benefits of incremental compilation are applied
# across the shared and platform-specific modules of your Kotlin Multiplatform project.
kotlin.incremental.multiplatform=true

# This property configures the caching mechanism for Kotlin/Native compilation, which is the process
# of compiling your Kotlin code to native binaries (e.g., for iOS).
#
# The Kotlin/Native compiler can cache the results of previous compilations to speed up subsequent
# builds. This property can have a few values, but static and none are the most common.
#
# - kotlin.native.cacheKind=static: This tells the compiler to create and reuse static libraries
#   from the compilation results of your project's dependencies. When you build your project, the
#   compiler checks if a cached version of a library is available. If it is, it reuses it instead of
#   recompiling from scratch. This significantly speeds up the linking phase of the native build
#   process.
#
# - kotlin.native.cacheKind=none: This disables the cache entirely, which can drastically slow down
# compilation times.
#
# By setting this to static, you are instructing the Kotlin/Native compiler to leverage caching as
# much as possible to accelerate build times for native targets like iOS.
kotlin.native.cacheKind=static
